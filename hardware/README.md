# Hardware Design

This directory contains hardware design files and documentation for the Integrated Electrical-Thermal Impedance Analysis System.

## System Components

The hardware system consists of several key modules:

### 1. Electrical Impedance Module (EIS)

The EIS module is responsible for measuring electrical impedance spectra across a wide frequency range (0.1Hz to 500kHz). Key components include:

- AD5940/ADuCM355 precision analog front-end
- Waveform generation circuitry
- Low-noise current source
- High-resolution voltage measurement
- Phase-sensitive detection circuitry
- Analog filters and signal conditioning

### 2. Thermal Impedance Module (TIS)

The TIS module measures thermal impedance by applying controlled thermal stimuli and measuring the temperature response. Key components include:

- Peltier element driver circuitry
- High-precision temperature sensors
- Thermal interface materials
- PCM (Phase Change Material) thermal management system
- Thermal isolation structures

### 3. Integrated Signal Processor

The signal processor combines and processes data from both EIS and TIS modules. It includes:

- FPGA-based signal processing unit
- High-speed data acquisition
- Digital filtering and signal processing
- Real-time analysis capabilities

### 4. Power Management Module

This module ensures efficient power delivery to all components of the system:

- High-efficiency switching power supplies
- Low-noise linear regulators
- Battery management (for portable versions)
- Power monitoring and protection circuits
