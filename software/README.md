## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from impedance_analyzer import IntegratedImpedanceAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = IntegratedImpedanceAnalyzer()

# Configure measurement parameters
analyzer.configure(
    electrical_freq_range=(0.1, 100000),  # Hz
    thermal_freq_range=(0.01, 1),         # Hz
    voltage_amplitude=10e-3,              # V
    thermal_pulse_power=100e-3,           # W
)

# Perform measurements
results = analyzer.measure()

# Analyze the results
characteristics = analyzer.analyze(results)

# Visualize
analyzer.plot_impedance_spectra(results)
```
