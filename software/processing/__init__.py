"""
Processing package for the Integrated Electrical-Thermal Impedance Analyzer

This package contains modules for processing and analyzing electrical and 
thermal impedance data, including signal processing, noise reduction, and
equivalent circuit modeling.

Modules:
- signal_processing: Core signal processing utilities
- electrical_models: Electrical equivalent circuit models
- thermal_models: Thermal equivalent circuit models
- noise_reduction: Noise filtering and reduction techniques

Based on the methodology described in the patent:
열 임피던스와 전기 임피던스 통합 분석 시스템 및 방법
(Integrated Electrical-Thermal Impedance Analysis System and Method)
