## Signal Flow

The signal flow through the system follows this sequence:

1. The user configures measurement parameters through the software interface
2. The Integrated Signal Processor sets up both EIS and TIS modules with appropriate parameters
3. The Thermal Management System stabilizes the temperature of the device under test
4. The EIS module applies AC signals at multiple frequencies and measures the electrical response
5. The TIS module applies thermal stimuli at multiple frequencies and measures the thermal response
6. The Integrated Signal Processor collects raw data from both modules
7. The AI-Based Analysis Engine processes the integrated data to extract system characteristics
8. Results are displayed to the user and can be exported for further analysis
