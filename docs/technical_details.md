## Measurement Principles

### Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)

The electrical impedance spectroscopy module applies a small AC voltage signal (typically 10mV to 100mV) across the sample and measures the resulting current response. The impedance is calculated as the complex ratio of voltage to current:

Z(ω) = V(ω) / I(ω) = |Z|e^(jφ) = Z' + jZ''

Where:
- Z(ω) is the complex impedance at angular frequency ω
- |Z| is the impedance magnitude
- φ is the phase angle
- Z' is the real part (resistance)
- Z'' is the imaginary part (reactance)

The measurement is performed across a logarithmically spaced frequency range, typically from 0.1Hz to 500kHz, to capture different physical processes occurring at different timescales.

### Thermal Impedance Spectroscopy (TIS)

The thermal impedance spectroscopy module applies a modulated thermal power input to the sample and measures the resulting temperature response. The thermal impedance is calculated as:

Z_th(ω) = ΔT(ω) / P(ω) = |Z_th|e^(jφ_th) = Z_th' + jZ_th''

Where:
- Z_th(ω) is the complex thermal impedance at angular frequency ω
- ΔT(ω) is the temperature response amplitude
- P(ω) is the thermal power input amplitude
- |Z_th| is the thermal impedance magnitude
- φ_th is the thermal phase angle
- Z_th' is the real part (thermal resistance)
- Z_th'' is the imaginary part (thermal reactance)

The measurement is performed at lower frequencies (typically 0.001Hz to 1Hz) due to the slower nature of thermal processes.

### Integrated Measurement Approach

The system's unique capability lies in the simultaneous acquisition and analysis of both electrical and thermal impedance data. This is achieved through:

1. **Temporal Separation**: The electrical and thermal stimuli are carefully timed to prevent interference.

2. **Crosstalk Compensation**: Mathematical modeling is used to correct for any interactions between electrical and thermal responses.

3. **Synchronous Sampling**: Both signals are sampled with appropriate timing to maintain phase relationships.

4. **Frequency Domain Transformation**: Time domain data is converted to frequency domain using FFT with windowing to minimize spectral leakage.

5. **Data Fusion**: The electrical and thermal impedance spectra are combined to extract comprehensive system characteristics.

## Advanced Signal Processing

### Multi-Frequency Acquisition

The system employs multi-tone techniques to simultaneously measure impedance at multiple frequencies, significantly reducing measurement time. This is particularly important for thermal impedance measurements where the low frequency range would traditionally require very long measurement times.

### Adaptive Frequency Resolution

The frequency resolution is dynamically adjusted based on the system's response characteristics. Regions with significant impedance changes are measured with higher frequency resolution to capture important features.

### Noise Reduction

Advanced noise reduction techniques are applied:

1. **Wavelet Transform**: Multi-resolution analysis for separating signal from noise across different frequency bands
2. **Adaptive Kalman Filtering**: Real-time tracking of signal parameters with noise rejection
3. **Particle Filtering**: Non-linear state estimation for complex physiological systems

### Model Fitting

The system employs sophisticated model fitting algorithms to extract physical parameters from impedance data:

1. **Equivalent Circuit Models**: For electrical impedance data (e.g., Randles circuit, transmission line models)
2. **Thermal Network Models**: For thermal impedance data (e.g., Foster/Cauer networks)
3. **Combined Electro-Thermal Models**: Unified models capturing coupled electrical-thermal behavior
