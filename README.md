## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for AI components)
- FPGA development tools (for hardware implementation)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJshome/electrical-thermal-impedance-analyzer.git
cd electrical-thermal-impedance-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from impedance_analyzer import IntegratedImpedanceAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = IntegratedImpedanceAnalyzer()

# Configure measurement parameters
analyzer.configure(
    electrical_freq_range=(0.1, 100000),  # Hz
    thermal_freq_range=(0.01, 1),         # Hz
    voltage_amplitude=10e-3,              # V
    thermal_pulse_power=100e-3,           # W
)

# Perform measurements
results = analyzer.measure()

# Analyze the results
characteristics = analyzer.analyze(results)

# Visualize
analyzer.plot_impedance_spectra(results)
