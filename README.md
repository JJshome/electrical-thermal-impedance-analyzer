## Scientific Background

Our approach builds upon the pioneering work of Barsoukov et al. in ["Thermal impedance spectroscopy for Li-ion batteries using heat-pulse response analysis"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378775302000800) (Journal of Power Sources, 2002), which first demonstrated the value of thermal impedance for battery analysis. We extend this concept by integrating electrical and thermal measurements into a unified analytical framework.

The thermal impedance function Z(s) can be approximated as a thermal impedance spectrum by analyzing the experimental temperature transient through Laplace transformation. This allows us to simultaneously obtain both the thermal capacity and thermal conductivity of the system through non-linear complex least-squares fitting of the spectrum.
